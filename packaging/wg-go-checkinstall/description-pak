fast, modern, secure kernel VPN tunnel (userland Go implementation)
 .
 WireGuard is a novel VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography (the
 "Noise" protocol). It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more
 useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to
 be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as
 a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super
 computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. It runs over
 UDP.
 .
 This package contains the user-space Go implementation, for use in
 places where the Linux Kernel module cannot be used, such as ChromeOS
 Crostini containers.
